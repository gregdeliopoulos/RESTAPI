# Million Song Dataset RESTAPI
The presented web application was designed through the course of **Web Engineering** of Computing Science department, University of Groningen. 
It provides users with a simple functionality over the Million Song Dataset by the CORGIS dataset project (https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/music/).
Through this project we designed a **RESTful API**, which we implemented in the back-end of our web application and we developed a simple front-end user interface for the application.
We tried our web-app to support the basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functions and to supply users with some features based on the dataset.
