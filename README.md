# RESTAPI
Web Engineering Project from Group 23
  
  To open the API Documentation extract the restapi_group23.zip file, open the terminal into main folder ('RESTAPI') and type 
  apidoc -i myapp/ -o apidoc/ .
  That should update the file 'index.html' inside myapp/ folder which is the documentation.
